## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Wanted to store all my smaller Python projects into one repository so that it can be viewed by anyone that is interested. Feel free to check the ideas and suggest improvements. This repository is valid during all phases of my journey so it might contain some older code with worse styling. I am happy to improve it.
